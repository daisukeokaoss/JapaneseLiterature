Imagery sketch
An Asura in Spring

Introduction

The phenomenon called me
Assumed organic alternating current lamp
It is one blue lighting
(Any transparent ghost complex)
When to talk with the landscape and everyone
While the blasphemy flickers
Indeed certainly keep sticking
Causal AC lighting
It is one blue lighting
(lightwave is remain, that electric light is lost)

These are twenty-two months
From the direction of relaxing past
Paper and mineral ink plucked
(All flickering with me
Everyone feels at the same time)
The weak points so far
One shadow of light and shade
It is a sketch of that other thing

About these people, galaxies, shura and sea ​​urchin are
Cosmic dust while breathing air or saline
Would you like to have fresh body theory
They are also one of the badges
It is certain that these books that were recorded
With this record of the birds recorded
If it is nothing then emptiness itself will be with this
We will share it to everyone to some extent
(Everything is everyone in me
It's all in everyone's)
